## Wu grammars in HPSG

The *DELPH-NG* project implements Wu Chinese grammars in [HPSG](http://hpsg.stanford.edu/) using the [DELPH-IN](http://delph-in.net)
infrastructure, based on [*zhong*](https://github.com/delph-in/zhong). *zhong* itself is the core grammar of structures
hypothesized to be common to all Chinese languages, and this project
includes grammars for Wu Chinese languages that inherit from the
core grammar. The *zhong* core grammar is derived from
[ManGO](http://moin.delph-in.net/MandarinGrammarOnline) Mandarin grammar,
which is based on the [Grammar Matrix](http://www.delph-in.net/matrix/).
